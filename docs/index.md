# zoal-honeycomb User Guide

This guide is for normal users of the Profile Editor UI.

You do not need YAML knowledge to create or edit profiles.

## What This Guide Covers

- What each section in the app means
- How to safely edit an existing profile
- How to create a new profile in the app

## Start Here

1. Read [Profile Field Reference](profile-fields.md)
2. Use [Edit an Existing Profile](edit-existing-profile.md) for small changes
3. Use [Create a New Profile](create-new-profile.md) for unsupported aircraft

## Important Notes

- Use the `Form` tab for normal editing.
- `Save`/`Save As` works when running inside SkyScript.
- If you see `Browser mode: read-only`, you can view profiles but cannot save from this UI.
