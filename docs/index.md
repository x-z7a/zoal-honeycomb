# zoal-honeycomb User Guide

This guide is for normal users of the Profile Editor UI.

You do not need YAML knowledge to create or edit profiles.

## What This Guide Covers

- Which aircraft profiles are currently shipped
- What each section in the app means
- How to safely edit an existing profile
- How to create a new profile in the app

## Start Here

1. Read [Profile Field Reference](./profile-fields)
2. Check [Supported Planes](./supported-planes)
3. Follow [Install](./install) to set up files and mapping references
4. Use [Edit an Existing Profile](./edit-existing-profile) for small changes
5. Use [Create a New Profile](./create-new-profile) for unsupported aircraft

## Important Notes

- Use the `Form` tab for normal editing.
- `Save`/`Save As` works when running inside SkyScript.
- If you see `Browser mode: read-only`, you can view profiles but cannot save from this UI.
